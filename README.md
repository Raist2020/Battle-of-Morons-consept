Repository Description

Morones Battle Map – Pre-Alpha Concept
This is an early prototype of Morones Battle Map, a text-based adventure/concept engine. The engine is unique and experimental, designed to simulate hero movement, battles, and terrain encounters on a grid map.

⚠️ Important: This is a pre-pre-release concept. The game is text-based, many systems are placeholders, and the engine is not fully implemented.

How to Test

Clone or download the repository.

Open index.html in a modern web browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox recommended).

Click Mint NFT to create your hero.

Follow the instructions in the battle log, move your hero by clicking map cells.

Observe battle text, terrain descriptions, and hero stats updates.

All interactions are purely conceptual; this prototype focuses on demonstrating movement, battle messaging, and the text-based grid system.
